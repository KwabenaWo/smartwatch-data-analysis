# Smartwatch Data Analysis

This repository contains code and resources for analyzing smartwatch data. The data consists of various activities tracked by a smartwatch, including very active, fairly active, and lightly active minutes, recorded over a period of time.

## Data
The data is stored in a CSV file named smartwatch_data.csv. Each row in the dataset represents a recorded activity session and includes information such as the date of the activity, the type of activity, and the duration in minutes for each activity level.

## Analysis Steps

- **Data Loading**: The data is loaded from the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Necessary preprocessing steps are performed, such as converting date columns to datetime objects.
- **Data Visualization**: Various plots and graphs are created using Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize trends and patterns in the data.
- **Insights Generation**: Based on the visualizations, insights and observations about activity patterns and trends are generated.
